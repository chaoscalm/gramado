	The base kernel. KERNEL.BIN.
	The kernel directory is the place for building main 
components of the system.
	The source code for the base kernel is found
	in base/control/new.
	There are two main subdirectories here, control/ and exposed/.
	control/ is the place where we build the ring 0 part 
of the system. The disk image, the boot loader and the kernel base.
	exposed/ is the place where we build the ring 3 
main part of the system. The init process and the unix-like commands.
